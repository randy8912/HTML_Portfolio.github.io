<h1>The Best Movies According to Randy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr>

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This movie touches scientific aspects about time, the personal involvement in it and how we affect everything that happens.</p>

<h3>Captain fantastic</h3>
<p>Get's me everytime. It's about dealing with mental disease and fatherhood.</p>

<h3>The creator</h3>
<p>A futuristic movie that displays conflict between different countries and their interpretation of how to deal with nearly humanistic robots/machines.</p>
